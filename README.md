# Talk Away


TalkAway is an Platform that allows users to schedule face-to-face language classes while walking or touring with teachers or guides, offering a unique and immersive language learning experience.

The platform offers two class options: Walking Class, which is a 1-hour walking language class with 1 to 4 students, and Walking Tour Class, which is a 2 to 3-hour walking language class with 1 to 4 students. Users can browse the list of available teachers, choose a teacher and schedule a class.

During the class, the teacher guides the student on a walking tour and teaches the language along the way. After the lesson, the student evaluates the teacher and writes notes on what he or she has learned, while the teacher evaluates the student's performance on learning milestones and reviews the student's notes. Both the student's evaluation of the lesson and the teacher's review of the notes generate TalkCoins.

TalkCoins are a way to reward students for their performance and encourage them to continue learning. Students can use the TalkCoins they receive as a form of payment for the next class with the same teacher, or for rescheduling with another teacher.

Teachers can also use the TalkCoins they receive to promote their services to attract more students, offer discounts on their classes, or extend their view on the platform. The TalkCoins system allows the platform to grow sustainably, attracting new users and retaining current ones, while encouraging language learning in an interactive and fun way.
